Add an adhan audio file here to be used by the app.

- Filename: `adhan.mp3`
- Path: `assets/adhan.mp3`

Notes:
- Use a reasonably short adhan audio in mp3 format (10-60 seconds).
- On Android you can configure custom notification channel sound if you build a native binary (EAS or bare workflow) and place the sound in the Android `res/raw` folder (see Expo docs).
- On iOS custom notification sound requires bundling the sound in the native app and must be short (<=30s) and in proper format.
